## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ Python Program to find the sum of series 1^1+2^2+3^3... +N^N.
###  Aim
To write a Python program to find the sum of the series 1Â¹ + 2Â² + 3Â³ + ... + Ná´º.


###  Algorithm
1.Start the program.

2.Prompt the user to input the value of N.

3.Initialize a variable to store the sum and use a loop to calculate each term i^i and add it to the sum.

4.Display the final sum.


### ðŸ§¾ Program

```python
#Reg.NO - 212222040035
#Name - Dhareene R K
#Write your Code here
n=int(input())
m=0
for i in range(1,n+1,2):
    m=m+i
print("The sum of the series = ",m)


```
