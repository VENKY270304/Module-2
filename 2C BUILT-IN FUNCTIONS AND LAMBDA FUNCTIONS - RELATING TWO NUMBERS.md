## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS - Write a python program to convert the decimal number to binary number using built in functions.


### AIM  
To write a Python program to check the relation between two numbers — whether one number is greater than, equal to, or lesser than another — using a lambda function.


### ALGORITHM

1.Start the program.

2.Prompt the user to input a decimal number.

3.Use the built-in bin() function to convert the decimal number to binary.

4.Display the binary equivalent.



### PROGRAM
